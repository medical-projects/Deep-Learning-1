### VGGNET 
* VGGNet is a Convolutional Neural Network architecture proposed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman from the University of Oxford in 2014.
* This paper mainly focuses on the effect of the convolutional neural network depth on its accuracy. You can find the original paper of VGGNet which is titled [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition].(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)
