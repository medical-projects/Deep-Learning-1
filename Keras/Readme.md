#### Keras 

* Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. 
* Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages.
* Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. 
* It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. 
* Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.
* It combines four key abilities:

1. Efficiently executing low-level tensor operations on CPU, GPU, or TPU.
2. Computing the gradient of arbitrary differentiable expressions.
3. Scaling computation to many devices (e.g. the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab, which spans 27,000 GPUs).
4. Exporting programs ("graphs") to external runtimes such as servers, browsers, mobile and embedded devices.
